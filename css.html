        An agent is an entity that perceives its environment and takes actions to achieve its goals.
        Three applications of AI are healthcare diagnostics, autonomous vehicles, and virtual assistants.
        Search terminology includes terms like search space, search algorithm, heuristic function, and solution path.
        Fuzzy logic systems are used in applications such as control systems, pattern recognition, and decision-making
        processes.
        Bidirectional search explores from both the start and goal states, potentially reducing search time, while
        unidirectional search explores from the start state only, which might be faster in certain situations but may
        overlook more optimal paths.
